"""FR-014 mechanical enforcement (feature 028 T031a).

Runs `git diff --name-only <base>...HEAD` and asserts no file under
`packages/darnit/src/` or `packages/darnit-baseline/src/` is modified in
the current PR. Guards against a future maintainer accidentally adding
a "small helper" to product code from a parity-tests PR.

Fails loudly (not silently) when the base ref cannot be reached under
CI, since a shallow-clone runner that silently passes gives the
maintainer a false sense of coverage. PR #370 review fix.
