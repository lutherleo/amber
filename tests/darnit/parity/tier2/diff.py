"""Tier 2 diff: MCP tool JSON vs skill Markdown summary (feature 028 T020).

Compares the skill's user-facing summary against the raw tool output.
Any per-control status difference is a hard failure regardless of
authority level (FR-008 / T2-13). Unparseable skill output is a distinct
failure class from disagreement (FR-006a).
