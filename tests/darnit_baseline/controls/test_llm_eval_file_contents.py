"""Regression guard for issue #402.

Every `llm_eval` pass in `openssf-baseline.toml` previously declared
`files_to_include = ["$FOUND_FILE"]`. When the deterministic tier
(pattern/regex) resolved INCONCLUSIVE -- i.e., no candidate file
matched -- the `$FOUND_FILE` variable was never bound, so llm_eval
fired with `file_contents = {}` and the LLM had nothing to reason
about. In a 29-repo survey the LLM tier produced 9 non-answers, one
per PENDING_LLM consultation.

Fix (issue #402 option 1, TOML-only): every `llm_eval` pass now
enumerates real candidate paths so the handler's on-disk skip logic
can populate `file_contents` even without a preceding `file_exists`
PASS. This test locks that fix in place -- if a new `llm_eval` block
ships with lone `$FOUND_FILE`, we want it to fail here rather than in
a live audit's empty consultation.
