"""State definitions for the darnit run agent graph.

This module defines the shared state that flows between nodes in the
audit/collect_context/remediate pipeline.

Issue #146: feedback_questions were previously write-only — answers were stored
but never read by downstream nodes. This module makes the answer field explicit
and provides helpers so every node can consume collected feedback.
