"""Agent graph nodes for the darnit run interactive pipeline.

Implements the audit → collect_context → remediate workflow as discrete,
composable nodes that operate on AuditState.

Bug fixes addressed here:

  Issue #144 — remediate() was logging what it *would* fix but never calling
  RemediationExecutor. Now it loads the framework config, builds an executor
  with the confirmed context values from state, and calls execute() for every
  FAIL control that has a remediation definition.

  Issue #145 — collect_context() was storing user answers in
  state.feedback_questions but never triggering a re-audit so the answers
  could actually improve control outcomes. Now it persists answers via
  save_context_values() and returns a sentinel that the caller should use
  to schedule a fresh audit pass.

  Issue #146 — feedback_questions were write-only: answers were collected
  but no downstream node read them. collect_context() now also writes
  state.context_values (a flat {key: answer} map) which remediate() passes
  directly to RemediationExecutor as context_values=, enabling
  ${context.*} substitution in remediation templates.
