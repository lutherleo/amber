"""Composition resolution for darnit compliance implementations.

This module is the framework-internal entrypoint for the TOML-only composition
primitive defined in feature 013-plugin-composition. A composite implementation
declares ``[[compose]]`` blocks, ``[overrides."ID"]`` blocks, and an optional
``allow_conflicts`` flag in its TOML; this module resolves all of that into a
flat ``FrameworkConfig.controls`` dict that the rest of the framework can
consume without knowing composition exists.

Canonical references:

- Spec:  ``specs/013-plugin-composition/spec.md``
- Plan:  ``specs/013-plugin-composition/plan.md``
- TOML schema contract:
  ``specs/013-plugin-composition/contracts/toml-schema.md``
- Resolver API contract:
  ``specs/013-plugin-composition/contracts/resolver-api.md``
- Data model + resolution algorithm:
  ``specs/013-plugin-composition/data-model.md``

This module MUST NOT import any implementation package (Constitution
Principle I: Plugin Separation). Source frameworks are resolved via the
``darnit.implementations`` entry-point group through a parse-only loader
helper (``darnit.config.merger._parse_framework_only``); composition
recursion is the resolver's exclusive responsibility so its
``_resolution_stack`` is the single source of truth for cycle detection
(F-1 fix; research.md R-002).
