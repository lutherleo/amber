# Tasks: Packaging & Distribution Channels

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/012-packaging-distribution/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: This feature does not include a TDD test-first workflow because the deliverables are external release artifacts. Per-channel **smoke tests** (which exercise the published artifact end-to-end) are part of implementation and live in `.github/workflows/release-smoke.yml`. They are listed as implementation tasks, not as separate test-first tasks.

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story. Each user story maps to one implementation phase in `plan.md` and is independently shippable.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)
- **[Story]**: User story label (US1–US5) for traceability
- Each task names exact file paths

## Path Conventions

- `packaging/` — new top-level directory (release infrastructure)
- `.github/workflows/` — GitHub Actions workflows
- `docs/install/` — user-facing install documentation
- `packages/darnit-hello/` — worked example for the third-party plugin guide
- `kusari-oss/homebrew-tap` — separate repository (created in Phase 5)

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project directories, runbook skeleton, external publisher configuration.

- [X] T001 Create new top-level directory tree: `packaging/{pypi,container,binary,homebrew,claude-plugin}/` and `docs/install/` with empty `.gitkeep` files (so git tracks the empty dirs)
- [X] T002 [P] Author `packaging/README.md` skeleton — maintainer-facing release runbook with stub sections per channel; will be amended per phase
- [X] T003 [P] Reconcile `pyproject.toml` URLs: in `/Users/mlieberman/Projects/baseline-mcp/pyproject.toml` change `Homepage`/`Repository`/`Issues` from `kusaridev/darnit-mcp` to `kusari-oss/darnit`; document the canonical repo home in `packaging/README.md`
- [ ] T004 **External — PyPI**: Configure Trusted Publisher on `pypi.org` for project `darnit-mcp` (and each public package) — repo `kusari-oss/darnit`, workflow `release.yml`, environment `release`. Record the configuration steps in `packaging/README.md`
- [ ] T005 **External — TestPyPI**: Configure Trusted Publisher on `test.pypi.org` mirroring T004 for pre-release flow

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: The single-tag-drives-everything release pipeline scaffolding. No channel work can begin until this is in place.

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story (US1–US5) tasks may start until Phase 2 is complete.

- [X] T006 Create `packaging/pypi/public-packages.txt` enumerating the four public packages (`darnit`, `darnit-baseline`, `darnit-gittuf`, `darnit-mcp`) one per line; treat any package not listed as internal-only
- [X] T007 For each public package, audit `packages/<pkg>/pyproject.toml` for required release metadata (name, version, license="Apache-2.0", description, classifiers, README inclusion, dependency pins) and fix gaps; ensure the `version` fields are uniform across all four packages
- [X] T008 Create `.github/workflows/release.yml` with the `on.push.tags` filter from `contracts/release-workflow-contract.md`, the documented `permissions:` block, and a single `preflight` job that runs the version-consistency check, the existing `ruff` + `pytest` + `validate_sync.py` + `generate_docs.py` gates, and aborts on any failure. No channel jobs yet.
- [X] T008a Extend `preflight` to enforce FR-002 ("no out-of-band inputs"): assert there are no uncommitted changes against the tagged commit (`git diff --exit-code` and `git diff --cached --exit-code`), and run `actionlint` over `.github/workflows/release.yml` to verify no secrets are referenced outside the documented `permissions:` block.
- [X] T009 [P] Create `.github/workflows/release-smoke.yml` skeleton with no jobs — placeholder for per-channel smoke jobs added in subsequent phases
- [X] T010 [P] Add a `release-yml-lint` CI job (in an existing PR-validation workflow, or a new tiny workflow) that runs `actionlint` against `.github/workflows/release.yml` and `.github/workflows/release-smoke.yml` on every PR
- [X] T011 [P] Add `packaging/RECOVERY.md` skeleton with one empty section per channel (`pypi`, `container`, `binary`, `homebrew`, `claude_plugin`); each phase fills its own section
- [ ] T012 Tag the repository with a no-op release candidate `v0.0.0rc0` to dry-run the preflight job; confirm the workflow runs, gates pass on a clean tree, and no channel job executes (because none exist yet). Delete the tag after.

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready — channel work can begin per user story.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 — Python user installs from a package index (P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: `pip install darnit-mcp==<version>` and `pipx install darnit-mcp==<version>` succeed against PyPI; pre-releases work against TestPyPI. Sigstore signatures attached.

**Independent Test**: Tag `v0.0.0rc1` from a clean branch → workflow publishes 4 sdist+wheel pairs to TestPyPI → on a clean container, `pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --pre darnit-mcp==0.0.0rc1` succeeds → `darnit --version` returns `0.0.0rc1` → `python -m sigstore verify identity --bundle ... darnit_mcp-0.0.0rc1-...whl` verifies.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T013 [US1] Add a `pypi_publish` job to `.github/workflows/release.yml` that runs after `preflight`. For each package in `packaging/pypi/public-packages.txt`: `uv build --package <pkg> --out-dir dist/<pkg>/`. Assert that the package name appears in `public-packages.txt` before any upload (refuse to publish unlisted packages).
- [X] T014 [US1] In the `pypi_publish` job, use `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1` with `attestations: true`. Target `https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/` for stable tags and `https://test.pypi.org/legacy/` for pre-release tags (detected via the `rc` suffix in `github.ref_name`).
- [X] T015 [US1] Add a `pypi_smoke` job to `.github/workflows/release-smoke.yml` that triggers after the release workflow's `pypi_publish` completes. In a clean Python container, `pip install --index-url <selected> --pre <pkg>==<version>` for each public package and run a per-package smoke (for `darnit-mcp`: `darnit --version` matches `<version>`; for others: import smoke).
- [X] T016 [US1] Extend `pypi_smoke` to verify the Sigstore bundle for `darnit_mcp` via `python -m sigstore verify identity --cert-identity-regexp '^https://github\\.com/kusari-oss/darnit/' --cert-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`. Fail the smoke if the signature does not verify.
- [X] T017 [P] [US1] Write `docs/install/pypi.md` per the PyPI section of `quickstart.md`, including the Sigstore verification command
- [X] T018 [P] [US1] Populate the `pypi` section of `packaging/RECOVERY.md` with the manual yank-and-retry recipe when an upload fails mid-flight
- [ ] T019 [US1] Run the end-to-end test from the Independent Test above against a real `v0.0.0rc1` tag; confirm all assertions hold

**Checkpoint US1**: PyPI/pipx install path is live; pre-release flow validated against TestPyPI.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 — CI/CD pipeline runs darnit from a container image (P2)

**Goal**: `ghcr.io/kusari-oss/darnit:<tag>` is published per release for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`, cosign-signed, with an SBOM attestation, and small enough to pull quickly.

**Independent Test**: After a `v0.0.0rc2` tag publishes successfully → on a clean machine with only Docker, `docker pull ghcr.io/kusari-oss/darnit:v0.0.0rc2 && docker run --rm ghcr.io/kusari-oss/darnit:v0.0.0rc2 --version` returns `0.0.0rc2` → `cosign verify ghcr.io/kusari-oss/darnit:v0.0.0rc2 --certificate-identity-regexp ... --certificate-oidc-issuer ...` verifies.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [X] T020 [US2] Author `packaging/container/Dockerfile` with the multi-stage build per `contracts/container-image-contract.md`: builder stage installs `darnit-mcp==<version>` (version passed as `ARG VERSION`) into a venv; runtime stage based on `python:3.12-slim`, installs `git` + `gh` via apt with caches purged, copies the venv, creates non-root user `darnit` (uid 10001), sets `WORKDIR /repo`, sets `ENTRYPOINT`/`CMD`
- [X] T021 [US2] Write `packaging/container/entrypoint.sh` per the contract — dispatch on first positional arg (`audit`/`remediate`/`list-controls`/`--version`/`--help` → `darnit`; `mcp` → `darnit-mcp`; anything else → exec direct)
- [X] T022 [US2] [P] Write `packaging/container/README.md` describing the image's contents, supported architectures, and entry-point usage (this README is mirrored to the GHCR overview page)
- [X] T023 [US2] Add a `container_build_push` job to `.github/workflows/release.yml`, gated on `pypi_publish` success. Use `docker/setup-qemu-action` + `docker/setup-buildx-action` + `docker/build-push-action` with `platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64`. Tag policy from the contract (stable: `:vX.Y.Z` + `:latest`; pre-release: `:vX.Y.Zrc<N>` only). Pass `--build-arg VERSION=<version>`.
- [X] T024 [US2] In the same job, after push, run `cosign sign --yes ghcr.io/kusari-oss/darnit@${DIGEST}` using OIDC keyless signing
- [X] T025 [US2] After signing, run `syft ghcr.io/kusari-oss/darnit@${DIGEST} -o spdx-json > sbom.spdx.json` and attach via `cosign attest --yes --predicate sbom.spdx.json --type spdx ghcr.io/kusari-oss/darnit@${DIGEST}`
- [X] T026 [US2] Add compressed-size reporting: capture `docker manifest inspect` JSON, sum compressed sizes per arch, post to job summary; emit a `::warning::` (not failure) if growth >15% vs the previous release (look up previous size via `gh release view`)
- [X] T027 [US2] Create a separate `.github/workflows/container-edge.yml` triggered on `push` to `main` that builds and pushes `:edge` (no signing, no SBOM); record this is non-release in the README
- [X] T028 [US2] Add a `container_smoke` job to `release-smoke.yml`: pull the published tag, run `darnit --version`, then run the `cosign verify` command from the contract
- [X] T029 [P] [US2] Write `docs/install/container.md` per the quickstart's container section, including the SBOM download command
- [X] T030 [P] [US2] Populate the `container` section of `packaging/RECOVERY.md` with the digest-pinning + re-push recipe for partial failures
- [ ] T031 [US2] Run the end-to-end test from the Independent Test above against a real `v0.0.0rc2` tag

**Checkpoint US2**: Container image is live on GHCR, signed, multi-arch.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 — Engineer installs via the platform's native package manager (P3)

**Goal**: Four signed standalone binaries (macOS arm64/amd64, Linux arm64/amd64) attached to each GitHub Release; `brew install kusari-oss/tap/darnit` works on macOS and Linux.

**Independent Test**: After a `v0.0.0rc3` tag → binaries appear on the GH Release; `cosign verify-blob` succeeds for each; the Homebrew tap PR auto-merges within 30 min for the stable follow-up tag; `brew tap kusari-oss/tap && brew install darnit && darnit --version` succeeds on macOS arm64 and Linux amd64.

### Implementation for User Story 3 — binary side

- [X] T032 [US3] Author `packaging/binary/shiv.toml` with `console-script = "darnit"`, `python = "/usr/bin/env python3.11"`, `compressed = true`. Test locally first to confirm the resulting zipapp runs.  _(Delivered as `packaging/binary/build-binary.sh` — shiv has no native TOML config format; script captures the canonical invocation.)_
- [X] T033 [US3] Add a `binary_matrix` job to `.github/workflows/release.yml` with strategy matrix `os ∈ {macos-14, macos-13, ubuntu-22.04, ubuntu-22.04-arm}` mapping to four `(os, arch)` artifact filenames. Run `shiv` per matrix entry; output `darnit-<version>-<os>-<arch>` in `dist/binary/`.
- [X] T034 [US3] In `binary_matrix`, sign each output: `cosign sign-blob --yes --bundle darnit-<version>-<os>-<arch>.sigstore darnit-<version>-<os>-<arch>`
- [X] T035 [US3] In `binary_matrix`, generate SBOM via `syft <binary> -o spdx-json > <binary>.sbom.spdx.json` and attest via `gh attestation create --predicate-type https://spdx.dev/Document --predicate <sbom> <binary>`
- [X] T036 [US3] After all four matrix entries complete, run `gh release create v<version> --title "v<version>"` (use `--prerelease` for `rc` tags, `--latest` for stable) with all eight files attached: `darnit-<version>-<os>-<arch>` + `.sigstore` for each `(os, arch)`
- [X] T037 [US3] Add a `binary_smoke` job to `release-smoke.yml` with the same matrix; each runner downloads its matching binary, runs `--version`, and runs `cosign verify-blob` per the contract
- [X] T038 [P] [US3] Write `docs/install/binary.md` per the quickstart's binary section, including the Python 3.11+ prerequisite and the `cosign verify-blob` command
- [X] T039 [P] [US3] Populate the `binary` section of `packaging/RECOVERY.md`

### Implementation for User Story 3 — Homebrew side

- [ ] T040 **External** [US3]: Create the `kusari-oss/homebrew-tap` repository with a public README, default branch `main`, no other content yet
- [ ] T041 **External** [US3]: Create a GitHub App (or use an existing org App) with `contents: write` on `kusari-oss/homebrew-tap`; configure the resulting token as the secret `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` in `kusari-oss/darnit`; document the steps in `packaging/README.md`
- [X] T042 [US3] Write `packaging/homebrew/darnit.rb.tmpl` per the formula template in `contracts/homebrew-formula-contract.md` (Jinja-style placeholders: `{{ version }}`, `{{ sha256_<os>_<arch> }}`, `{{ binary_url_template }}`)
- [X] T043 [US3] Add a `homebrew_dispatch` job to `release.yml` (stable tags only — gate on absence of `rc` in `github.ref_name`). The job depends on `binary_matrix` success, computes SHA-256 of each of the four binaries, and dispatches a `repository_dispatch` event to `kusari-oss/homebrew-tap` with the payload schema from the contract.
- [X] T044 [US3] In `kusari-oss/homebrew-tap`, author `.github/workflows/bump-formula.yml` triggered on `repository_dispatch` with type `darnit-release`. The workflow validates the payload, renders `Formula/darnit.rb` from the vendored `darnit.rb.tmpl` (copied into the tap on dispatch), runs `brew style` + `brew install --build-from-source`, opens a PR titled `darnit <version>`, and `gh pr merge --auto --squash`s it.  _(Reference copy delivered in `packaging/homebrew/tap-workflows/bump-formula.yml`; maintainer copies into the tap repo on T040.)_
- [X] T045 [US3] In `kusari-oss/homebrew-tap`, author a tiny `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that runs `brew style Formula/*.rb` and `brew install --build-from-source Formula/darnit.rb` on every PR (this is what gates the auto-merge in T044)  _(Reference copy delivered in `packaging/homebrew/tap-workflows/ci.yml`.)_
- [X] T046 [US3] Add a `homebrew_smoke` job to `release-smoke.yml` (stable tags only) that polls `gh pr list --repo kusari-oss/homebrew-tap` for the bump PR, waits up to 30 min for merge, then on macOS-14 and ubuntu-22.04 runners runs `brew tap kusari-oss/tap && brew install darnit && darnit --version | grep "<version>"`
- [X] T047 [P] [US3] Write `docs/install/homebrew.md` per the quickstart's Homebrew section
- [X] T048 [P] [US3] Populate the `homebrew` section of `packaging/RECOVERY.md` (manual formula revert recipe)
- [ ] T049 [US3] Run the end-to-end test: tag `v0.0.0rc3`, confirm binaries publish; then tag `v0.0.0` (the first real stable) and confirm Homebrew formula auto-merges + smoke passes within 30 min

**Checkpoint US3**: Standalone binaries + Homebrew tap are live for end users.

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 — Coding-agent user installs darnit as a plugin (P4)

**Goal**: `darnit-claude-plugin-<version>.zip` is attached to each stable GH Release; structural smoke passes; behavioral smoke passes if Claude Code plugin tooling is available.

**Independent Test**: After a stable tag → the zip artifact exists on the release; unzipping it reveals manifest + skills/ as specified; `jq -e '.version == "<version>"'` passes; the MCP-invocation shell snippet runs `darnit --version` correctly when `uvx` is installed in a clean container.

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [X] T050 [US4] Write `packaging/claude-plugin/manifest.json` per the schema in `contracts/claude-plugin-contract.md`, with `<version>` as a placeholder. Pin the manifest schema version (`mcpServers`, `skills`) and document the pinned version inline.  _(Delivered as `packaging/claude-plugin/templates/plugin.json` — actual filename is `plugin.json` per the Claude Code spec, lives at `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` inside the bundle. Skills are auto-discovered from the bundle's `skills/` directory, not enumerated in the manifest.)_
- [X] T051 [US4] Write a small `packaging/claude-plugin/build.sh` (or inline in the workflow) that copies `skills/` from the repo root into `packaging/claude-plugin/skills/`, substitutes `<version>` in `manifest.json`, and produces `darnit-claude-plugin-<version>.zip`  _(Build script copies skills verbatim from `packages/darnit/src/darnit/skills/`; no rename. The Agent Skills standard requires directory name to match the frontmatter `name:` field. Plugin-namespaced invocation is `/darnit:darnit-audit`.)_
- [X] T052 [US4] Write `packaging/claude-plugin/README.md` documenting install steps, the `uvx`/`pipx` prerequisite, and the schema-version pin
- [X] T053 [US4] Add a `plugin_package` job to `.github/workflows/release.yml` (stable tags only). The job depends on `pypi_publish`, runs `build.sh`, asserts skill count == 4 and skill paths match `skills/` contents, then uploads the zip to the GitHub Release via `gh release upload`
- [X] T054 [US4] Add a `plugin_structural_smoke` job to `release-smoke.yml`: download the zip, run the structural assertions from the contract (`unzip -t`, `jq` on manifest, skill-path diff)
- [X] T055 [US4] Add a `plugin_behavioral_smoke` job to `release-smoke.yml` that runs the FR-017 fallback chain shell snippet directly in a container with `uvx` available, asserting `uvx --from darnit-mcp@<version> darnit-mcp --help` succeeds. If Anthropic publishes a Claude Code plugin test harness in time for v1, extend this job to install the plugin and assert all four skills are exposed.  _(Behavioral smoke exercises both the uvx-available happy path AND the no-runner-available actionable-error path with exit 127 verification.)_
- [X] T056 [P] [US4] Write `docs/install/claude-code-plugin.md` per the quickstart's plugin section
- [X] T057 [P] [US4] Populate the `claude_plugin` section of `packaging/RECOVERY.md`
- [ ] T058 [US4] Tag a stable release and confirm the plugin smoke passes end-to-end

**Checkpoint US4**: Claude Code plugin artifact ships with every stable release.

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 — Third-party team ships their own implementation plugin (P5)

**Goal**: An external developer can read `docs/packaging-plugins.md`, copy the `darnit-hello` example, and publish a working darnit implementation that darnit auto-discovers.

**Independent Test**: A test team unfamiliar with darnit's source follows `docs/packaging-plugins.md`, ends up with a new package `<their-pkg>` that registers via the `darnit.implementations` entry point; after `pip install <their-pkg>`, darnit's `list_controls` MCP tool shows their controls and an audit runs.

### Implementation for User Story 5

- [X] T059 [US5] Write `docs/packaging-plugins.md` covering: minimum `pyproject.toml`, entry-point declaration (`darnit.implementations`), `register()` callable contract, `ComplianceImplementation` protocol surface (cross-link to `CLAUDE.md` and `openspec/specs/framework-design/spec.md`), TOML control layout, `register_handlers()`, testing with `darnit-testchecks` patterns, Sigstore signing of plugin wheels, `[plugins].trusted_publishers` config in `.baseline.toml`, distribution paths (PyPI / private indexes / git)
- [X] T060 [P] [US5] Create `packages/darnit-hello/pyproject.toml` declaring the package, entry point `darnit-hello = "darnit_hello:register"`, dependency on `darnit`, Python `>=3.11`  _(Slug is `hello` not `darnit-hello` to match the implementation's `name` property; `darnit-hello` is the package distribution name.)_
- [X] T061 [P] [US5] Create `packages/darnit-hello/src/darnit_hello/__init__.py` with the `register()` function returning an instance of `DarnitHelloImplementation`  _(Class named `HelloImplementation` for consistency with the slug.)_
- [X] T062 [US5] Create `packages/darnit-hello/src/darnit_hello/implementation.py` with a minimal `DarnitHelloImplementation` exposing one control via `get_framework_config_path()` pointing at `hello.toml`
- [X] T063 [US5] Create `packages/darnit-hello/src/darnit_hello/hello.toml` with one control (e.g., "README.md exists") using the `file_must_exist` handler — single source of truth, TOML-first  _(`hello.toml` lives inside `src/darnit_hello/`, NOT at the package root. Hatchling auto-includes anything inside the package source, so the wheel ships it correctly without `force-include`. See guide for why.)_
- [X] T064 [P] [US5] Create `packages/darnit-hello/README.md` mirroring the structure new third parties would write
- [X] T065 [US5] Add an `integration_plugin_discovery` CI job to the existing PR-validation workflow that `pip install -e packages/darnit-hello`, then `uv run darnit list-controls` (or equivalent) and asserts the hello control appears in the output. Asserts an end-to-end audit of the control passes.  _(Implemented as `plugin_discovery_smoke` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Verifies entry-point discovery, protocol conformance, and TOML control set.)_
- [X] T066 [P] [US5] Cross-link `docs/packaging-plugins.md` from `README.md` and `openspec/specs/framework-design/spec.md`
- [ ] T067 [US5] Run the Independent Test: have a non-author follow the guide top-to-bottom and report whether they can ship a discoverable plugin in <1 engineering day

**Checkpoint US5**: Third-party packaging guide is live with a working example and a CI check that keeps it working.

---

## Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Stitch the channels together with cross-cutting docs and finalize the partial-failure observability.

- [X] T068 [P] Write `docs/install/README.md` with the decision-tree table from `quickstart.md` (situation → channel) plus links to each per-channel doc
- [X] T069 [P] Update root `README.md` install section: replace clone+uv prose with a one-paragraph summary and a link to `docs/install/README.md`
- [X] T070 Finalize `packaging/RECOVERY.md` — confirm each channel section is filled, add a generic "how to file a release-failure issue" section
- [X] T071 Add a `finalize` job at the end of `.github/workflows/release.yml` with `if: always()`. The job MUST: (a) capture each per-channel job's `completed_at - workflow_started_at` elapsed time; (b) aggregate per-channel pass/fail + elapsed into a job-summary markdown table; (c) compute `homebrew_dispatch_to_merge_seconds` from the tap-repo PR (when applicable); (d) flag any channel exceeding 30 minutes from tag push (SC-007 budget); (e) on any failure OR over-budget channel for a stable tag, create a GitHub issue tagged `release-failure` containing channel name, tag, workflow-run URL, measured elapsed times, the SC-007 budget, and a quoted recovery snippet from `packaging/RECOVERY.md`; (f) embed the timing table in the auto-generated GitHub Release notes.
- [X] T071a Add `timeout-minutes: 30` to the `.github/workflows/release.yml` workflow at the workflow level for stable tags only (pre-release tags are not bound by SC-007). If any per-channel job exceeds this budget, the workflow is cancelled and `finalize` (T071) records the timeout as a `release-failure`.  _(GitHub Actions has no workflow-level `timeout-minutes` for push-triggered runs; SC-007 is enforced by per-job timeouts (bounded individual jobs) + the finalize job's total-elapsed check. Documented in the inline finalize-job comment.)_
- [X] T072 [P] Finalize `packaging/README.md` runbook with the full end-to-end release ceremony (verify branch state → bump versions → push tag → monitor → triage failures)
- [ ] T073 End-to-end quickstart validation: run every command in `quickstart.md` against the most recent stable release on a fresh macOS arm64 host and a fresh Linux amd64 host; record outcomes in `packaging/README.md`  _(Deferred to actual first stable release — requires a real `vX.Y.Z` tag to validate against.)_
- [X] T074 Confirm that none of the changes regressed existing tests: `uv run ruff check . && uv run pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/integration/ -q && uv run python scripts/validate_sync.py --verbose && uv run python scripts/generate_docs.py && git diff --exit-code docs/generated/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: T001–T005 — no internal dependencies; T004/T005 are external maintainer actions
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: depends on Phase 1; T012 (no-op dry-run) is the gate that proves the foundation works
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: all depend on Phase 2 completion; some channels have cross-story dependencies:
  - **US2 (container)** depends on **US1 (PyPI)** because the Dockerfile installs from PyPI
  - **US3 (binary + Homebrew)** depends on **US1 (PyPI)** for `darnit-mcp` source and on **Phase 2** for the workflow scaffolding; the Homebrew side depends on the binary side
  - **US4 (Claude plugin)** depends on **US1 (PyPI)** for the runtime invocation
  - **US5 (third-party guide)** depends only on Phase 2; no cross-story coupling
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: depends on all user stories being complete

```

### Within Each User Story

- Local Dockerfile/manifest authoring before workflow jobs
- Build job before signing before SBOM before smoke
- Documentation [P] tasks can run any time within the story (parallel with implementation)
- Recovery-doc [P] tasks can run any time within the story

### Parallel Opportunities

- **All [P] docs tasks** can be written by the same or different contributor in parallel with implementation
- **Within US2**: T022 (README) is [P] with T020–T021 (Dockerfile authoring)
- **Within US3**: binary and Homebrew sides are sequentially coupled (Homebrew depends on binaries); within each side, docs/recovery tasks are [P]
- **Within US4**: T056/T057 docs are [P] with T050–T053 implementation
- **Within US5**: T060, T061, T064, T066 are [P] with each other and with T059 (guide writing)
- **Phase 8**: T068, T069, T072 are [P]
- **Across stories** (once Phase 2 is in): US2, US3-binary, US4, US5 can all proceed in parallel with US1, gated only on US1's PyPI publish for the cross-story dependencies named above

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# After Phase 2 + US1 are complete:

# Contributor A picks up Dockerfile + entrypoint:
Task: "Write packaging/container/Dockerfile per contract" (T020)
Task: "Write packaging/container/entrypoint.sh per contract" (T021)

# Contributor B simultaneously writes user-facing docs:
Task: "Write packaging/container/README.md" (T022)
Task: "Write docs/install/container.md" (T029)
Task: "Write container section of packaging/RECOVERY.md" (T030)

# Then jointly:
Task: "Wire up container_build_push job in release.yml" (T023)
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 5 (mostly parallelizable)

```bash
# After Phase 2 is complete (no other stories needed):

# Four contributors can split:
Contributor A: T059 (docs/packaging-plugins.md)
Contributor B: T060, T061 (darnit-hello scaffolding)
Contributor C: T062, T063 (darnit-hello implementation + TOML)
Contributor D: T064, T066 (README + cross-links)

# Then sequentially:
T065 (CI integration check) — depends on B + C
T067 (third-party usability test) — depends on A + all the above
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP scope — ship User Story 1 first

The MVP is **Phase 1 → Phase 2 → User Story 1**. After T019, darnit is installable via `pip install darnit-mcp` and `pipx install darnit-mcp` with verifiable Sigstore signatures. That alone is a step change from today's "clone the repo and use uv" reality. Stop here and demo before starting US2.

### Incremental delivery — channel by channel

1. **MVP** (T001–T019): PyPI install path live with pre-release flow.
2. **+ US2** (T020–T031): Container image live for CI users.
3. **+ US3** (T032–T049): Binary + Homebrew live for native-package users.
4. **+ US4** (T050–T058): Claude Code plugin live for agent users.
5. **+ US5** (T059–T067): Third-party plugin guide + worked example live.
6. **+ Polish** (T068–T074): Decision-tree doc, finalized recovery doc, partial-failure issue automation, end-to-end validation.

Each step is shippable on its own. Each step can be tagged as a real release (`v0.1.0`, `v0.2.0`, ...) so users adopt one new channel per release rather than waiting for everything.

### Parallel team strategy

With multiple contributors, after Phase 2 completes:

- **Lead contributor** owns US1 + the cross-cutting workflow infrastructure (Phase 2 is theirs).
- **Once US1 lands**, branch out:
  - Container person picks up US2.
  - Binary/brew person picks up US3 (longest stretch — most coupling).
  - Plugin person picks up US4.
  - Docs person picks up US5 + Phase 8.
- The release-engineering choices in `research.md` are all upfront, so contributors don't get blocked on architectural decisions mid-stream.

## Notes

- Tag patterns used in tasks above:
  - `v0.0.0rc0` (T012): no-op dry-run of preflight only
  - `v0.0.0rc1` (T019): US1 validation
  - `v0.0.0rc2` (T031): US2 validation
  - `v0.0.0rc3` (T049): US3 binary side validation
  - `v0.0.0` (T049): first real stable for the Homebrew side smoke
  - Real `v0.1.0`: first user-facing release (after at least US1 + US2 are landed; recommended after US3 too)
- The Homebrew tap repo (`kusari-oss/homebrew-tap`) is created in T040 and is **outside this repository tree**. Tasks T044–T045 land in that repo; everything else is in `kusari-oss/darnit`.
- The third-party packaging guide example (`packages/darnit-hello/`) is **not** published to PyPI from this repo. It is in-tree only as a copy-paste source for external developers.
- Smoke tests live alongside their channels in `release-smoke.yml`; they exercise the **published artifact**, not pre-publish builds. A smoke failure does not unpublish.
- Pre-release tags (`rcN` suffix) skip Homebrew (T043) and Claude plugin (T053) jobs by design; this is a hard rule enforced in the workflow `if:` conditions, not a soft guideline.
- Commit after each task or each logical group. Each [P] doc task is independently committable.

## Future work (out of scope for v1)

These tasks were identified during v1 implementation but explicitly deferred. They do not block any v1 task and are not required for the spec's success criteria.

- [ ] **TF-001 Cross-agent SKILL.md install path.** Add a `darnit install-skills [--agent <slug>]` CLI subcommand modelled after [spec-kit's `specify init`](https://github.com/github/spec-kit). Mirror their pattern:
  - An `AGENT_CONFIG` dict mapping agent slugs (`claude-code`, `cursor`, `copilot`, `codex`, `opencode`, `goose`, ...) to per-agent skill-install paths.
  - A single source-of-truth — the existing `packages/darnit/src/darnit/skills/darnit-*/SKILL.md` files, no transformation needed since they already conform to the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io/specification).
  - A `generic` fallback that installs to `.agents/skills/` for unrecognised agents.
  - A sensible default (`copilot` or whatever the user's environment most often runs).
  - Optional MCP-server wiring per agent — but each agent has its own MCP config format, so this is the harder half. The v1 Claude Code plugin wraps the MCP server; for v2 cross-agent, document the MCP setup per agent rather than try to automate it everywhere.

  **Why deferred**: v1 ships the Claude Code plugin because that's darnit's primary install audience today. The Agent Skills ecosystem is large (~30 clients per [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io)), but per-agent install adapters are a separate maintenance surface from the release pipeline. Tackle this once v1 is stable in the field.

- [ ] **TF-002 Plugin marketplace submission.** When Anthropic ships a public Claude Code plugin marketplace, submit `darnit-claude-plugin-<version>.zip` for listing. v1 distributes via the GitHub Release asset only.

- [ ] **TF-003 Bundled binary fallback in the plugin.** If the user-facing complaint becomes "I have neither `uvx` nor `pipx` and I just want darnit to work", bundle the platform-specific shiv binary inside the plugin zip and have the runner script prefer it over `uvx`/`pipx`. Trade-off: per-platform plugin zips (or a fat plugin with all four binaries).
