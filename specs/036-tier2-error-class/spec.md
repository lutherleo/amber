# Feature Specification: Distinguishable Side-Effect Failures via `error_class`

**Feature Branch**: `036-tier2-error-class`

**Created**: 2026-09-06

**Status**: Draft

**Input**: User description: "Implement issue #419 -- Determinism Tier 2: network / side-effect failures must be distinguishable from real verdicts. Add a structured `error_class` field to `HandlerResult` evidence so operators can tell 'we couldn't verify (network/auth/timeout failed)' apart from 'we verified and it concluded FAIL/WARN'. Bump the log level on those failures from DEBUG to WARN. Surface `error_class` distinctly in markdown/JSON/SARIF report output. Attestation predicate should also carry `error_class` when present."

## Clarifications

### Session 2026-09-06

- Q: How is `error_class` propagated from pass attempts to the higher-level CheckResult? -> A: From the RESOLVING pass's HandlerResult only. Earlier failed passes' `error_class` values are dropped, matching "first conclusive result wins" pipeline semantics.
- Q: How is the `error_class` enum represented and extended in future releases? -> A: Strict `Literal` type at the code layer with the six named values in v0. Expanding the enum requires a code change and new release; runtime rejects unknowns. Matches feature 025's `authority` pattern.
- Q: What is the scope of the DEBUG-to-WARN log-level bump? -> A: Bump exactly the four named sites (MCP handler per FR-006, exec timeout per FR-007, orchestrator crash per FR-007, context auto-detect git failures per FR-008). Sweeping other DEBUG-level exception handlers is deferred as follow-ups triggered by real-audit evidence.
- Q: What is the scope of rate-limit / auth detection heuristics in the exec handler? -> A: GitHub-only patterns for v0 (`gh` CLI stderr shape). Unclassified subprocess failure falls back to `error_class = network` for stderr-matched patterns and `crashed` for unexpected exceptions. Follow-ups add per-target pattern packs (git, curl, others) when real audits surface the need.

## Context

Darnit currently produces a single verdict envelope per control -- `PASS` / `FAIL` / `WARN` / `INCONCLUSIVE` / `ERROR` -- with no structured indicator of WHY a non-PASS verdict landed. Concretely: an audit run against a repo behind a corporate proxy that blocks `api.github.com` gets a stream of `gh api` timeouts, each recorded as `ERROR` (or worse, silently as `FAIL` after CEL evaluates against empty evidence), indistinguishable in the report from a control that actually ran cleanly against a live network and concluded the repo does not satisfy the check.

For a compliance tool, the operator's mental model needs to distinguish:

- **Verified failure**: the check ran; the repo does not comply.
- **Could-not-verify**: the check could not run to completion (network unreachable, auth token expired, rate limit hit, subprocess crashed).

Constitution Principle II (Conservative-by-Default) requires WARN to be treated as FAIL for compliance calculations, so both cases still gate the audit correctly -- but they need different operator responses. A verified failure is a repo problem the operator should fix. A could-not-verify is an environment problem the operator should fix by, e.g., unblocking network egress or refreshing an auth token.

This feature adds an `error_class` field to the result envelope that carries a small enum of environmental failure causes, surfaces it in the report layer, and stops swallowing these signals at DEBUG log level.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Operator sees "network failed" separately from "check failed" in report output (Priority: P1)

An operator runs `darnit audit` against a repo. Their auth token is expired; `gh api /repos/.../license` returns non-zero exit with a 401 body. Before this feature: the control reports `ERROR - Command failed` or `FAIL - CEL expr evaluated false against empty evidence`, and the operator's first instinct is to look at the repo. After this feature: the control's report entry includes `error_class: auth`, making it obvious the fix is to refresh `GH_TOKEN`, not to change the repo.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary user-visible outcome. Without it the operator can't triage the audit correctly.

**Independent Test**: Force `gh api` to return a 401 (or run without `GH_TOKEN` set) against a control that shells out to `gh`. Inspect the markdown report and confirm the affected control shows an environmental error class alongside its verdict, not just a bare failure message.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a control whose exec handler shells out to `gh api /repos/OWNER/REPO/license` and `GH_TOKEN` is invalid, **When** the audit runs, **Then** the control's report entry includes `error_class = auth` and the operator can distinguish it from a control that returned FAIL via a clean CEL evaluation.
2. **Given** a control whose exec handler times out (`gh` process exceeds handler timeout), **When** the audit runs, **Then** the control's report entry includes `error_class = timeout`.
3. **Given** a control whose exec handler exits non-zero with rate-limit-shaped stderr (`API rate limit exceeded`), **When** the audit runs, **Then** the control's report entry includes `error_class = rate_limit`.
4. **Given** a control whose exec handler runs cleanly and the CEL expression concludes false, **When** the audit runs, **Then** the control's report entry has NO `error_class` (verdict is a real failure).

---

### User Story 2 - Environmental failures land in default log output at WARN (Priority: P1)

Today an operator running `darnit audit` sees INFO-level progress but no indication that half the sieve passes are silently timing out under the hood -- those log at DEBUG. After this feature, environmental failures log at WARN so the default log level surfaces the problem without requiring the operator to know to bump verbosity.

**Why this priority**: Without loud logging, operators don't realize their audit was degraded. They see the report, treat WARN counts as real, and act on wrong information.

**Independent Test**: Run an audit with default log level; force some subset of side-effect handlers to error (e.g., unset `GH_TOKEN` so `gh api` fails). Confirm the stderr contains WARN-level log lines identifying which control and which `error_class` triggered.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** default log level (INFO for stderr), **When** an exec handler times out, **Then** a WARN log line names the control ID, the handler, and `error_class = timeout`.
2. **Given** default log level, **When** an MCP handler hits a network exception, **Then** a WARN log line names the MCP tool and `error_class = network` (or `handshake_failed`).
3. **Given** default log level, **When** the context auto-detect chain has a git subprocess failure, **Then** a WARN log line names the context key and `error_class`.
4. **Given** an audit that successfully runs to completion with zero environmental failures, **When** the audit runs, **Then** there are NO new WARN log lines from this feature (the change is silent in the happy path).

---

### User Story 3 - JSON and SARIF outputs machine-consume `error_class` (Priority: P2)

An operator or downstream tool consumes the JSON or SARIF report programmatically. After this feature, when a control has an `error_class`, it appears as a distinct top-level field on the result object (not buried in `details`), so downstream tools (dashboards, ticketing integrations, CI job classifiers) can branch on it.

**Why this priority**: This is a machine-consumer story; humans have Story 1. Slower payoff but foundational for the fleet-operator persona.

**Independent Test**: Run an audit that produces at least one environmental failure. Parse the JSON output; confirm the affected control has `error_class` at the same nesting depth as `status`.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** JSON output format, **When** a control has environmental error, **Then** the control's JSON object has an `error_class` field at the same level as `status` and `id`.
2. **Given** SARIF output format, **When** a control has environmental error, **Then** the SARIF result has an `error_class` property in the `properties` bag.
3. **Given** neither JSON nor SARIF, **When** a control has no environmental error, **Then** the `error_class` field is absent (not `null`; not present).

---

### User Story 4 - Attestation predicate carries `error_class` when present (Priority: P2)

A control whose audit was gated by an environmental failure MUST have that fact recorded in the in-toto attestation predicate, so a later verifier looking at the signed evidence can see the audit was produced under degraded conditions.

**Why this priority**: Attestations are the durable audit artifact. A bare PASS/FAIL in a signed attestation, when the underlying audit was actually an environmental failure, is exactly the kind of misleading claim compliance tooling must not produce.

**Independent Test**: Generate an attestation for an audit run that had at least one environmental failure. Parse the attestation predicate; confirm the affected control's result entry carries `error_class`.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an audit run that produced a control with `error_class = network`, **When** an attestation is generated, **Then** the attestation predicate's per-control entry for that control includes `error_class = "network"`.
2. **Given** an audit run with no environmental failures, **When** an attestation is generated, **Then** no result entry carries an `error_class` field (attestation shape is unchanged in the happy path).

---

### Edge Cases

- **Handler returns non-zero exit AND CEL expression evaluates false**: the exec-then-CEL layer currently transitions PASS + CEL-false to INCONCLUSIVE and FAIL + CEL-false to FAIL (per `_apply_cel_expr` in the orchestrator). Neither transition should silently strip a pre-existing `error_class` set by the handler. If the handler set `error_class = timeout` and CEL evaluated against empty evidence, the final result should still carry `error_class = timeout`.
- **Multiple handlers in a pass chain each set different error_class values**: only the RESOLVING pass's `error_class` propagates to the CheckResult (per clarify Q1 / FR-009a). A later pass that resolves the control on its own evidence supersedes an earlier pass's environmental error; the earlier `error_class` is discarded rather than aggregated.
- **No pass resolves the control (all-inconclusive WARN)**: there is no resolving pass, so FR-009a has nothing to select. FR-009b governs: the most recent non-null `error_class` across the chain propagates. Non-null specifically, because a trailing `manual` placeholder pass would otherwise erase the real failure that preceded it -- see FR-009b's rationale.
- **Handler doesn't classify its own failure**: exec-handler catches a bare `OSError` it wasn't expecting. `error_class` defaults to `crashed`, not to no-error-class-at-all, so the operator still sees "something environmental went wrong" rather than a silent misclassification as FAIL.
- **Rate-limit detection is heuristic (stderr text-match)**: GitHub's rate-limit response is a 403 with specific header shape. Our exec handler only sees stdout/stderr/exit-code, so classification relies on stderr matching known patterns (`API rate limit exceeded`, `secondary rate limit`, `abuse detection`). Misclassification lands in `auth` or generic `network`; not fatal, just less precise.
- **`error_class` conflicts with the existing top-level `status`**: an `error_class = crashed` alongside `status = PASS` is a bug (a crashed handler can't produce a real PASS). The feature MUST make this shape unrepresentable in code (assertion or type constraint), not just document it.
- **Legacy consumers reading result envelopes**: any external consumer of the JSON envelope must ignore unknown fields; the `error_class` field is additive and OPTIONAL. Existing tests that assert exact-shape equality on result envelopes will need to be updated to allow the new field, but any that check specific known keys will pass unchanged.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The result envelope produced by every handler (`HandlerResult`) MUST support an optional `error_class` field that carries a small enumerated string.
- **FR-002**: The `error_class` enumeration is a strict `Literal` type at the code layer (per clarify Q2), with v0 values exactly: `network`, `auth`, `timeout`, `rate_limit`, `not_found`, `crashed`. Expanding the enum in a future release requires a code change (adding a value to the Literal) plus a new darnit release.
- **FR-002a**: Because `typing.Literal` is a static-analysis construct with no runtime effect, the six-value set MUST also exist as a runtime-checkable `frozenset` alongside the Literal, and `HandlerResult.__post_init__` MUST raise `ValueError` when `error_class` is set to a value outside that set. Rationale: a compliance tool that silently accepts a malformed `error_class` would emit an attestation carrying an uninterpretable failure cause. Note that feature 025's `authority` field pairs its Literal with a frozenset for a *fail-safe* (`is_terminal_authority()` returns False for unknowns) rather than a rejection; this feature chooses rejection because an unknown `error_class` has no safe default -- it is neither "the check failed" nor "the check could not run".
- **FR-003**: When the `exec` handler catches `subprocess.TimeoutExpired`, the result MUST carry `error_class = timeout`.
- **FR-004**: When the `exec` handler observes a non-zero exit and stderr matches known GitHub API rate-limit patterns (per clarify Q4: `gh` CLI stderr shape only for v0), the result MUST carry `error_class = rate_limit`. Non-GitHub targets fall through to FR-005a's generic `network` fallback.
- **FR-005**: When the `exec` handler observes a non-zero exit and stderr matches known GitHub auth-failure patterns (HTTP 401 / 403 without rate-limit signal / expired token, per clarify Q4 GitHub-only v0 scope), the result MUST carry `error_class = auth`. Non-GitHub targets fall through to FR-005a's generic `network` fallback.
- **FR-005a**: When the `exec` handler observes a non-zero exit that does NOT match a known GitHub pattern from FR-004 or FR-005, the result MUST carry `error_class = network` (per clarify Q4 fallback rule). Unexpected exceptions from the handler itself land in `crashed` via FR-007.
- **FR-006**: When the `mcp` handler catches `McpToolTimeout`, the result MUST carry `error_class = timeout`. When it catches `McpServerHandshakeFailed`, MUST carry `error_class = network`. When it catches `McpServerBinaryMissing`, MUST carry `error_class = not_found`. Every other `McpPoolError` subclass MUST also be classified, per the complete mapping table in `contracts/error-class.md` section 2.2 -- leaving any catchable MCP exception unclassified would reintroduce the exact ambiguity this feature removes.
- **FR-007**: When the orchestrator's outer try/except catches an unexpected handler exception (line 410-422 area), the result MUST carry `error_class = crashed` and the log MUST fire at WARN (not DEBUG).
- **FR-008**: When the context auto-detect chain fails a git subprocess call (`detect_platform` and similar), the failure MUST be logged at WARN (not DEBUG) with the context key name and appropriate `error_class`.
- **FR-008a**: The DEBUG-to-WARN bump scope is exactly the four sites named in FR-006, FR-007 (both clauses), and FR-008 (per clarify Q3). Other DEBUG-level exception handlers in the codebase are NOT swept in v0; they are follow-up candidates when real audits surface the need.
- **FR-009**: The `_apply_cel_expr` post-step MUST preserve any `error_class` set by the pre-CEL handler result, even when the CEL evaluation transitions the status.
- **FR-009a**: The higher-level `CheckResult` MUST carry `error_class` from the RESOLVING pass's `HandlerResult` only (per clarify Q1). Earlier non-resolving passes' `error_class` values are dropped, matching "first conclusive result wins" pipeline semantics. This preserves the CheckResult's scalar shape and lets downstream classifiers branch on a single value.
- **FR-009b**: When NO pass resolves the control -- every pass returns INCONCLUSIVE and the control terminates as WARN -- FR-009a's "resolving pass" does not exist. In that case the `CheckResult` MUST carry the most recent non-null `error_class` observed across the pass chain.

  Rationale: this is the single most common shape for a degraded audit, and the strict FR-009a reading leaves it with no explanation at all. An operator whose token expired sees a bare "Could not automatically verify - manual verification required" and never learns why, which defeats US1 entirely. With no conclusion to supersede it, the most recent environmental failure is the best available explanation.

  This does not contradict FR-009a: it only applies where FR-009a is silent (no resolving pass exists), and it preserves FR-009a's ordering intent (a later signal supersedes an earlier one).

  **Most recent NON-NULL, not simply most recent.** Nearly every control in the OpenSSF Baseline TOML ends with a `manual` pass -- an "ask a human" placeholder that always returns INCONCLUSIVE and can never conclude anything. Treating that trailing placeholder as "the final attempt ran cleanly" would erase the real `exec` failure preceding it, which is precisely the degraded-audit case this requirement exists to serve.

  A control where every pass ran cleanly and was merely inconclusive MUST still carry no `error_class` -- "we genuinely could not determine" is a different answer from "we could not check."
- **FR-010**: The markdown formatter MUST surface `error_class` as an inline annotation on the affected control (e.g., "OSPS-XX-01.01: ERROR [network] - <message>"). The exact rendering may be refined during implementation; the requirement is that `error_class` is visually distinguishable from the verdict.
- **FR-011**: The JSON formatter MUST include `error_class` as a top-level field on each result object when present, at the same nesting depth as `status`. When absent, the field MUST NOT be emitted (not `null`, not empty string).
- **FR-012**: The SARIF formatter MUST include `error_class` in each result's `properties` bag when present.
- **FR-013**: The attestation predicate (darnit-baseline in-toto attestation) MUST carry `error_class` per-control when present.
- **FR-014**: An audit that produces zero environmental failures MUST produce identical output (markdown, JSON, SARIF, attestation) to the pre-feature output in those formats -- the feature is silent in the happy path.
- **FR-015**: The feature MUST NOT introduce any new runtime dependency.

### Key Entities

- **`HandlerResult`**: existing sieve-level result object. Extended additively with an optional `error_class` field.
- **`error_class` enumeration**: strict `Literal["network", "auth", "timeout", "rate_limit", "not_found", "crashed"]` at the code layer (per clarify Q2). Expansion is a code change + release.
- **CheckResult**: the higher-level per-control result the audit driver emits. Also extended additively with `error_class`, populated from the resolving pass's `HandlerResult`.
- **Attestation predicate result entry**: existing per-control entry in the in-toto predicate (`darnit-baseline/attestation/predicate.py`). Extended additively with `error_class` when present.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: An operator running an audit with an expired auth token can identify from the markdown report alone (no debug flags) which specific controls failed due to auth vs which failed against a working environment. Verified by driver-level integration test that mocks a subset of `gh api` calls to return 401 and asserts the report distinguishes.
- **SC-002**: An audit run with zero environmental failures produces byte-for-byte identical markdown / JSON / SARIF output as the pre-feature implementation. Verified by golden-file regression test on a fixture repo with all deterministic controls.
- **SC-003**: An audit whose sieve pipeline hits any `error_class`-triggering condition emits at least one WARN log line at default log level. Verified by test that patches a handler to raise a classified environmental error and inspects captured log output.
- **SC-004**: The attestation predicate for a control that had `error_class = network` contains the `"error_class": "network"` field at the same schema depth as `status`. Verified by generating a predicate from a mocked-failure audit and asserting the JSON shape.
- **SC-005**: The `_apply_cel_expr` post-step does not strip `error_class` under any of its four status-transition cases (PASS+true, PASS+false, FAIL+true, FAIL+false). Verified by unit test parameterized over all four transitions.
- **SC-006**: Adding `error_class` to `HandlerResult` does not break any existing test. Verified by full framework + baseline test suite passing.
- **SC-007**: The feature adds no new runtime import (grep for third-party import additions is empty). Verified by explicit test that greps `pyproject.toml`'s runtime dependency set for the touched files.

## Assumptions

- The feature is implemented additively; no existing field on `HandlerResult` or `CheckResult` is renamed or removed. Legacy consumers see the new field as unknown-but-optional.
- Rate-limit and auth heuristics are GitHub-only for v0 (per clarify Q4), stderr-text-based against `gh` CLI output shape. Perfect classification is out of scope for v0; the fallback is `network` for unclassified subprocess failure and `crashed` for unexpected exceptions. Per-target pattern packs for other tools (git, curl, syft, cosign) are follow-ups triggered by real-audit evidence.
- Log-level bump (DEBUG -> WARN) applies to environmental failures only. Handler-happy-path logging (successful subprocess invocations, cache lookups) stays at DEBUG.
- The attestation predicate change is additive within the v1 predicate schema (matches the pattern feature 025 used to add `authority` per RFC-0001 Stage 1). No predicate version bump.
- The markdown/JSON/SARIF formatter changes are opt-in-by-shape (they inspect whether `error_class` is set; no config flag needed to enable rendering).
- The scope excludes fixing the `_load_merged_stores` DEBUG-only logging path in `tools/audit.py:550-600` -- the survey named it as a related gap but it's about missing-framework context loading, distinct from the sieve-handler failure classification. Treated as a follow-up.

## Dependencies

- Feature 025 / RFC-0001 Stage 1 (`authority` field on `HandlerResult` and result envelopes) -- the same additive-extension pattern is applied here.
- Feature 034 / PR #412 (local-fs and user-local backends) -- not a strict dependency, but the store-side changes from feature 035 and issue #418 (Tier 1 determinism) already ship structural improvements to the same layer this feature extends.
- Determinism companion issues #418 (Tier 1), #420 (remediation atomicity), #421 (LLM reasoning capture) -- Tier 3 (#421) will consume `error_class` in attestation; that consumer wiring lives in #421's scope, not here.

## Out of Scope

- **Retrying failed network calls**. Retry masks nondeterminism without fixing it and adds a whole design conversation about backoff, budgets, and cross-run state. Separate feature.
- **An offline-mode CLI flag**. Also separate.
- **Fixing the `value_if_fail` semantics in the detect pipeline**. PR #417 already handled that case.
- **Reworking `_load_merged_stores` logging** in `tools/audit.py`. Distinct code path; follow-up.
- **Structured error causes beyond the six-value enum**. v0 ships the six; v1+ may add finer buckets (`dns_failure`, `tls_error`, `proxy_blocked`) as real audits surface the need.
- **Non-GitHub target pattern packs** (git, curl, syft, cosign). Per clarify Q4, v0 classifies GitHub-only; other exec targets fall through to `network`. Per-target packs are follow-ups.
- **Machine-readable `error_class` in the human markdown output**. Markdown gets an inline annotation for humans; JSON / SARIF / attestation carry the structured form for machines.
